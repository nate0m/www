      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling that the way that I was using my android smart phone is very cluttered compared to how I use my laptop and desktop linux systems. While I was browsing Fdroid I found a possible solution to my problem in a minimalist launcher.&#xA;Current day android running on my pixel 6 is fine but I wanted something more. I find that the multitude of apps within folders and widgets scattered across my home screen is not something that I find pleasant to interface with.</description>

      <description>The New Great Depression is a great tune by band The Moth &amp;amp; The Flame with a fantastic music video that sparked my interest. Please watch the video and come back if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in my analysis.&#xA;Over the past year I have been reading a lot of Carl Jung. I started with Man and His Symbols then moved onto his Red Book. Both were enlightening though I could use another read of both for comprehension and understanding especially The Red Book.</description>
