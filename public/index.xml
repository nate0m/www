      <description>There are a few sections which are unfinished. In the future I might fill them in or if you know the correct description for what is left out then submit a pull request on github.&#xA;Brief Introduction JBD bms’s are popular inexpensive battery management systems that are sold on jiabaida’s website directly but are more commonly purchased on aliexpress. This is my first experience with a JBD bms and this is also my first fully custom battery build.</description>

      <description>Premise My uncle asked me to install this tesla auto frunk kit on his model Y. The instructions and videos online do an ok job (I followed this video) with helping you along the installation process but are not as concise as I would like. Here I will cover my own installation experience with images and advice to help you have a smooth installation also for my own future reference if I decide to install another one of these kits.</description>

      <description>The Need for a Cell Tester Recently I started harvesting cells from discarded ebike batteries. Naturally this meant that I needed a way to test the health of these cells. When you test the health of a cell there are a few things that you need to check that being the capacity, maximum voltage, and internal resistance. Most important being the capacity as this is the amount of charge the cell can hold and directly relates to the amount of energy the cell can hold.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a college student and last semester did not go very well. I was taking a lot of classes where I had to take physical notes and keep track of a lot of different handouts. Basically I had a bunch of paper that I needed to keep organized. So I went to target bought a binder and some separators for it and started to organize. This worked for a little bit but eventually the paper won the war of attrition.</description>

      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been feeling that the way that I was using my android smart phone is very cluttered compared to how I use my laptop and desktop linux systems. While I was browsing Fdroid I found a possible solution to my problem in a minimalist launcher.&#xA;Current day android running on my pixel 6 is fine but I wanted something more utilitarian. I find that the multitude of apps within folders and widgets scattered across my home screen is not something that I find pleasant to interface with.</description>

      <description>The New Great Depression is a great tune by band The Moth &amp;amp; The Flame with a fantastic music video that sparked my interest. Please watch the video and come back if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in my analysis.&#xA;Over the past year I have been reading a lot of Carl Jung. I started with Man and His Symbols then moved onto his Red Book. Both were enlightening though I could use another read of both for comprehension and understanding especially The Red Book.</description>

      <description>whomai My name is Nathan but my friends call me Nate. I&amp;rsquo;m a 21 year old college student. I&amp;rsquo;m studing computer engineering and I work at an electric bike company. In my free time I enjoy doing little software projects or working in my workshop. I have a very large amount of interests which makes it difficult to focus on one thing. I&amp;rsquo;m always bouncing from one project to another.</description>
