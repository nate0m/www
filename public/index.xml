      <title>Fuck Dirtbike Tires</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/post/2025/08/05/fuck-dirtbike-tires/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I work in a bike shop where I change tires all the time. It’s basically second nature to me at this point. I forgot to mention it’s an ebike shop so most of the bikes have those big fat tires. So when my dirtbike needed new tires I thought ‘no problem I do this all the time on bikes how much harder can it be for a dirtbike’, oh boy I had no idea what I was getting myself into. It all started on a faithful day during the end of the fall semester of 2024. I was house sitting for my cousins, and had physics and calculus finals that I needed to cram for. But for some reason I had enough time to do the tire change on the dirtbike or at least I thought I did. I bought a dirtbike stand on facebook marketplace and a set of tires off of amazon. I sat my  bike on the stand in the driveway and started working. I’m going to spare you the details and just say, it did not go well. I had basically no idea what I was doing. I was using regular tire levers instead of spoons. The rear tire which was the one I opted to do first was extremely stiff. I ended up having to cut off the original before I could even think about putting the new one on. Basically the whole time I was just getting more and more frustrated at how hard it was to put new tires onto this dirtbike. I finally got the new tire almost entirely on… Then I pinched the tube… Then I gave up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was inspired by a couple of different designs on Printables.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/img/post/soldering-fan/1.png&#34; alt=&#34;solering fan inpiration images&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Originally I was going to use the first design but decided that it was a bit too complicated with all the different pieces you needed to print. I decided to make something with the same fan, a 120mm Noctua fan but in the style of the second one. My main design decision was to make it as simple as possible to accommodate different electronics in the bottom compartment. Another design decision that I made was to not have an internal battery because in my soldering kit I have a large power bank that I use to power the soldering iron and was going to use it to power the fan as well. This simplifies the design and makes it so I only have to charge one battery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are a few sections which are unfinished. In the future I might fill them in or if you know the correct description for what is left out then submit a pull request on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nate0m/www/blob/main/content/post/JBD-bms.md&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;brief-introduction&#34;&gt;Brief Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;JBD bms’s are popular inexpensive battery management systems that are sold on &lt;a href=&#34;https://jiabaida-bms.com/&#34;&gt;jiabaida’s website directly&lt;/a&gt; but are more commonly purchased on aliexpress. This is my first experience with a JBD bms and this is also my first fully custom battery build. I found that due to language barriers the JBD app which is used to set the parameters for your battery is slightly unintuitive and confusing. That is why this document exists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Naturally this meant that I needed a way to test the health of these cells. When you test the health of a cell there are a few things that you need to check that being the capacity, maximum voltage, and internal resistance. Most important being the capacity as this is the amount of charge the cell can hold and directly relates to the amount of energy the cell can hold.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I was taking a lot of classes where I had to take physical notes and keep track of a lot of different handouts. Basically I had a bunch of paper that I needed to keep organized. So I went to target bought a binder and some separators for it and started to organize. This worked for a little bit but eventually the paper won the war of attrition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I find that the multitude of apps within folders and widgets scattered across my home screen is not something that I find pleasant to interface with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Please watch the video and come back if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in my analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year I have been reading a lot of Carl Jung. I started with Man and His Symbols then moved onto his Red Book. Both were enlightening though I could use another read of both for comprehension and understanding especially The Red Book. After learning about the symbolic means of communication that the unconscious uses I have been using it to interpret media. Nowadays the media that people are interested in is like the myths that people were enthralled by in ancient times. By analyzing the symbols and associations of the media that people latch onto we can reach a greater understanding of their collective psyche.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was little the dsi came out and I asked for one for my birthday. This was after the 2008 financial crisis and my parents were going through a hard time and would soon get divorced. But they still went to the Game Stop and got me a pre owned dsi, a black one. I was so happy when I got it I didn’t even really care that much that the left bumper didn’t always work. The dsi was a special device at the time it had a lot of cool features that weren&amp;rsquo;t really gaming related, it could connect to the internet and you could use the camera to take pictures and it had a music player with little games built into it. It was a magical device to me. It also had a full sized sd card slot and by a stroke of pure luck the person that had had the dsi before me had not wiped the sd card, leaving a bunch of Beatles songs on it, and a handful of them were from Abbey Road. That was my first exposure to this album and that mean that this is technically the first album that I owned and for some reason I feel really lucky that whoever traded in that dsi left all those Beatles songs on it because if they didn’t then I wouldn’t have these memories of long car rides listening to Yellow Submarine or Octopus’ Garden, and maybe my outlook on life would be completely different. So I just want to say out into the void thank you to whoever put those songs onto that sd card and thank you for not wiping it before trading it in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
