My name is Nathan but my friends call me Nate. I'm a 21 year old college student. I'm studing computer engineering and I work at an electric bike company. In my free time I enjoy doing little software projects or working in my workshop. I have a very large amount of interests which makes it difficult to focus on one thing. I'm always bouncing from one project to another.
