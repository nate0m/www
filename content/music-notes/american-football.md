The worlds and my first introduction to Midwest-Emo. The understatedness of this album really sinks under my skin and puts my mind at ease. I love the opening track `Never Meant`, `Honestly` for it's honest proprial of teenage emotions, and `I'll See You Then We're Both Not So Emotional` for it's closing line. They defined a genre then dropped off the face of the earth.
