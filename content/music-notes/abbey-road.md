When I was little the dsi came out and I asked for one for my birthday. This was after the 2008 financial crisis and my parents were going through a hard time and would soon get divorced. But they still went to the Game Stop and got me a pre owned dsi, a black one. I was so happy when I got it I didn’t even really care that much that the left bumper didn’t always work. The dsi was a special device at the time it had a lot of cool features that weren't really gaming related, it could connect to the internet and you could use the camera to take pictures and it had a music player with little games built into it. It was a magical device to me. It also had a full sized sd card slot and by a stroke of pure luck the person that had had the dsi before me had not wiped the sd card, leaving a bunch of Beatles songs on it, and a handful of them were from Abbey Road. That was my first exposure to this album and that mean that this is technically the first album that I owned and for some reason I feel really lucky that whoever traded in that dsi left all those Beatles songs on it because if they didn’t then I wouldn’t have these memories of long car rides listening to Yellow Submarine or Octopus’ Garden, and maybe my outlook on life would be completely different. So I just want to say out into the void thank you to whoever put those songs onto that sd card and thank you for not wiping it before trading it in.
